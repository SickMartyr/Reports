Victim organization:
	Kaseya along with smaller businesses that used Kaseyas VSA software.

 Facts:
VSA is software for remote network management that is used by both businesses, MSPs, and IT companies that provide services.
 	Through a random chain attack that took advantage of Keseyas VSA software. An attack was triggered via an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Kaseya VSA web interface. Using the MSPS as a back door where a SQL injection was used to execute the exploit, fake update with a backdoor, and Sodinokibi as the payload. The CVE assigned for the vulnerability used is CVE-2021–30116.

Timeline:
	The group got notice that the vulnerability was exposed, Revil ransomware operators already exploited Kaseya by then. CEO announced at July 2nd @ pm EDT of the potential breach. By July 4th revised the incident with other 2 companies, July 5th a fix was made and deployed to SaaS environments. News article was published in July 23, 2021 at 5 am.

Damages:
- 30 MSPs were involved in the breach
“Huntress said in a Reddit explainer that an estimated 1,000 companies have had servers and workstations encrypted. The vendor added that it is reasonable to suggest "thousands of small businesses" may have been impacted.”
- “"We have not found evidence that any of our SaaS customers were compromised.””

Attribution:
the REvil ransomware gang

Motive: money??

Opinion: I think they acted real fast after finding out the vulnerability existed and were racing against Kaseya finally releasing a patch for it. Understandably, all of these small businesses that were breached in a way were small businesses with less than 30 employees, so in a matter of effect it wasn’t much.
