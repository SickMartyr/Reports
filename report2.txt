2. Facts
	This was a data breach compromising the websites user authentication database. The data extracted from this breach was authentication information for registered members’ emails, usernames, passwords, and Crypt-hashed passwords. Founder of Internet archived confirmed it was a data breach and stated that the threat actor used a JS library to show an alert to visitors. Then a few days later the website underwent an DDoS attack claimed by the BlackMeta hacktivist group.

7. Opinion
Considering government officials have been continually trying to shut down the wayback machine due to copyright laws, this seems as if a group is trying to get the website down even if it means scaring the public/DDoS attacking the website to make it unavailable
