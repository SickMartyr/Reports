7. Opinion
It was merely the government and the idea of them using any information gathered through any ISP provider is low. I believe there isn’t much for civilians to do in this extent to protect themselves, especially with no damages were seen to Cisco routers or ISPs core routers. Though this exposes the many vulnerabilities many companies neglect, along with how continuously hacking groups have gotten access to systems.
